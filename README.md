# Makeup-Api
Natural Glam is implemented using Makeup-api where you can get product details by searching product-type(ex: mascara,lipstick) or brand name(ex: colourpop,boosh).Wait for 2-3 seconds for records to load properly.
Under script.js :: Main script file containing above mentioned search logic.
Under script_bkp.js :: Contains logic for search + pagination. It is also working but not refined that is why it is not main script file.
